# Space_Shooter
Top down 2.5D/3D Space Shooter in UE4.
This is a University project, and the game has to be created from a Blank Unreal Engine 4 project, using mostly BluePrints to showcase my knowledge and also the learning process of that programming language. C++ and HLSL can be used for more in-depth tweaking and performance optimization, but they should be kept to a minimum.
Inspiration for the game: Space invaders, Super Stardust, Asteroids.
